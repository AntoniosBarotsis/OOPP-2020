# Backlog V1.2

(The lecturer can do everything a moderator can do.)

## Must have

- As a **user**, I can connect to only one room at a time, because I can only be present in one lecture.
- As a **lecturer** I can create a room with a name (preferably) and create 2 distinct links for moderator and students, so that moderators can have more privileges than students
- As a **moderator** I can delete/mark as answered questions, so that I keep some moderation
- As a **student**, I can ask questions during lectures, so that content not understood well can be elaborated.
- As a **student**, I can upvote questions by their fellow students, so an hierarchy of importance of questions can be made.
- As a **student** I can mark my questions as answered (unless too popular), so the top questions can be refreshed to questions not answered yet.
- As a **student**, I can remove my own questions. 
- Questions asked by users should be stored in a database (should not be deleted if anything goes wrong), so they can be exported at the end of the lecture.
- As a **moderator**, I can invite other moderators with a link that will be available the whole time.
- As a **lecturer**, I should have a more simple view, so that I can have a lecture without being distracted. 

## Should have

- As a **moderator**, I can see if the current pace is appropriate, so that I can design the lecture to be in the pace wanted by the students
- As a **moderator**, I can make poll questions with multiple possible answers and (optionally) share the statistics with the students only when I decide on that
- As a **lecturer**, I can schedule a room in advance, so that it is ready for when the lecture begins.
- As a **moderator**, I can reopen polls in later time, so that students can vote again and/or the results are available to students.
- As a **moderator**, I can download an event log, seeing who did what, to see which moderators and students were being active.
- As a **student**, I will have a cooldown on voting on pace and creating questions, so there is limited interaction with the server. 


## Could Have

- As a **moderator** I can ban users, so that offenders no longer access the lecture (ban based on an IP)
- As a **user** I should see questions updated in real time with push base update.
- Users can insert a username when joining a room so users are recognized.
- As a **moderator**, I can answer questions in text, so students can have their question answered, even if the lecturer doesn’t get to it, as well as write down the lecturer’s answer. 
- As a **moderator**, I should be able to export all questions / answered questions/ most relevant questions and polls.
- As a **moderator**, only one of us can answer a question.
- As a **student**, I can answer polls, which may consist of multiple correct answers.
- As a **student** and moderator, I can see an answer tab with previously asked questions.


## Won’t have
