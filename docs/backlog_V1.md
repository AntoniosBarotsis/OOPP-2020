# Backlog V1

(The lecturer can do everything a moderator can do.)

## Must have

- As a **user**, I can connect to only one room at a time, because I can only be present in one lecture.
- As a **lecturer**, I can create a room with a name (preferably) and create 2 distinct links for mods and students, so that mods can have more privileges than students
- As a **moderator** I can hide/delete/edit mark as answered questions, so that I keep some moderation
- As a **lecturer**, I can delete a room and have a fresh start with new one for my next lecture
- As a **student**, I can ask questions during lectures, so that content not understood well can be elaborated.
- As a **student** , I can upvote questions by their fellow students, so an hierarchy of importance of questions can be made.
- As a **student**, I can mark my questions answered (unless too popular), so the top questions can be refreshed to questions not answered yet.

## Should have

- As a **moderator**, I want questions to be sortable by either time created or upvotes so that I can see the most important questions
  - If a question gets very popular only mods can close it, so if the person asking understands the answer, and the rest don’t, the question will still be answered later.
- As a **user**, I can flag questions as spam, so moderators can decide what to do with them.
- As a **moderator**, I can merge duplicate questions together, so all questions are unique.

## Could Have

- As a **moderators/lecturer**, I want questions to have tags and be grouped together, so I can merge multiple questions that have the same meaning with one action.
- As a **lecturer**, I can schedule a room in advance, so that it is ready for when the lecture begins
- As a **lecturer**, I can see if the current pace is appropriate, so that I can design the lecture to be in the pace wanted by the students
- As a **moderator**, I can make poll questions and (optionally) share the statistics with the students only when I decide on that
- As a **moderator**, I can IP ban users, so that offenders no longer access the lecture
- As a **user** I should see questions updated in real time with push base update.
- As a **user**, I can insert a username when joining a room (system optionally gives them a random name suggestion), so users are recognized.
- The system could help visual impairment and others, colour blind etc.

## Won’t have
